# Windows
Similar to a Container, the Window contains a group of GUI elements. The Window has potential of being moved, resized, closed, minimized, and restored. Each of these features can be configured as enabled or disabled. Resizing a window will not change the scale of elements inside of the window, but may allow other elements to expand or contract if elements are configured to behave as such.<br>
